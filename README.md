# Pandemic Data Notebooks
A collection of notebooks exploring pandemic-related datasets


Todo: 
* [x] Include simple example with line list data from Global.health
* [x] Include simple example with of genomic data from GISAID
* [ ] Add list of useful papers
* [ ] Add list of pandemic data sets and sources

## Setup

These are python Jupyter notebooks. You can use Jupyter Lab, Google Colab, or similar to run these notebooks. I used a local Jupyter Lab running in a conda environment; see these [docs](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html). 

Python packages and libraries
* Basic stuff: Python core libraries, pandas. 
* I try to use limit requirements to those packages included in Anaconda. 
* For visualizations, I use altair, bokeh, or seaborn. 

## Data sets

Information about data sources is provided in each notebook.
